### CLIENT - Trade-up
Trade-up is a software company that aims to solve the inefficiency of the labour usage in Australian construction companies. The cost of employment as well as the cost of materials are consistent amongst subcontractors due to industrial relations and working conditions such as weather. Thus, it is vital to point out the amount of workers working on particular jobs in terms of economic terms. This will help to carry out work using the least amount of money.

Trade-up would like the techlauncher team to implement a few new features such as figuring out how many people are there on site, which can enhance their existing website system. Thus, the vision of Trade-up is to automate current default values associated with productivity of construction companies with existing and future data to generate such values.

### Team Members
The purpose of this project is to provide current Trade-Up users a resourcing module to the existing Trade-Up Platform. In other words, Trade-Up would like to automate the current default values to dynamic real-life values based upon past data. 

Trade-Up already provides services in tracking the productivity results of construction employees on a daily basis. This includes timesheets. This can now be enhanced by providing the user a workflow to first estimate the number of workers required to be rostered on each construction site, moving on to allocating specific workers and then disseminating the information to staff through electronic means. 

Different to other rostering systems in the marketplace, Trade-Up will incorporate daily results of project completion and work speed, combined with required project completion dates to give updated estimates of workers required to complete the project on time. 

The team have access to a demo company on the Trade-Up system with projects, employees and Timesheets entered to use as sample data.
